# Quick File Audit
**Path:** `server/src/db/schema.ts`
**Confidence:** high

The schema is well-structured and utilizes modern UUIDv7 practices. However, it lacks critical performance optimizations such as indexes on foreign keys and lookup columns. Furthermore, data integrity can be improved by replacing loose varchar fields with enums and adding check constraints for numeric ranges.

## Strengths
- Proper use of cascading deletes for relational integrity.
- Consistent use of UUIDv7 for primary keys, which is optimal for indexing.
- Clear and concise schema definition using Drizzle ORM.

## Issues
- Missing database indexes on foreign keys (incident_id) and frequently queried columns (email, createdAt) will lead to full table scans.
- The severity field in incidents and findings uses varchar instead of a pgEnum, risking data inconsistency.
- Lack of explicit database-level constraints for score ranges (e.g., 0-100) in the incidents table.

## Suggestions
- Add indexes to incident_id in findings and email in users to optimize join and lookup performance.
- Define a severity enum to enforce strict values at the database level.
- Add a check constraint to the score column in the incidents table to ensure data validity.
