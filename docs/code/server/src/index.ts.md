# Quick File Audit
**Path:** `server/src/index.ts`
**Confidence:** high

The implementation provides a solid foundation for log scanning but suffers from a critical stateful regex bug and lacks robust error handling for external API calls. Refactoring the scanning logic to be functional and adding defensive checks around the Axiom response will significantly improve reliability.

## Strengths
- Effective use of Hono middleware for security (CSRF, CORS, secureHeaders).
- Clear separation of concerns between API definition and server configuration.

## Issues
- [Lines 44-44] Regex statefulness: cardRegex.test() on a global regex maintains lastIndex, causing intermittent false negatives in loops.
- [Lines 37-37] Hardcoded environment: The query string is hardcoded to 'web-production', limiting utility and violating separation of concerns.
- [Lines 40-42] Error handling: The code assumes res.matches is always present if the query succeeds, potentially crashing on unexpected API responses.

## Suggestions
- [Lines 44-44] Replace cardRegex.test(logText) with logText.match(cardRegex) or reset lastIndex to 0 before each test.
- [Lines 37-37] Move the Axiom query string to a configuration file or environment variable.
- [Lines 40-42] Implement robust validation for the Axiom response object to ensure type safety before iteration.
- [Lines 43-52] Use Array.prototype.reduce or filter/map to transform matches into findings, improving readability.
- [Lines 37-37] Add error handling (try/catch) around the Axiom query to prevent unhandled promise rejections.
